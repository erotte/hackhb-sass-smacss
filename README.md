# MM_REVEAL

HTML is great, but after lots of projects with haml or slim i really don't want to write HTML manually.
It sucks.

This is just a simple middleman project with the reveal.js skeleton.

You will find the middleman template files in the source/ folder.
The outer layout is just a copy from the initial reveal.js index.html template 
with a <%= yield %> to render the slides sections.


## Attention

Take care of the asset files and folders in source/!
